## About Me

I am a Technical Fellow at the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in Berkeley, CA. I am broadly interested in the verification, optimization, design, and analysis (VODA) of complex interconnected aerospace systems. At UTRC, I lead multiple projects in the areas of uncertainty quantification, discrete optimization, and quantum computation. I particularly enjoy working at the interface of multiple discplines and consequently finding common themes and connections. Prior to joining UTRC, I earned my Ph.D. in January 2008 from Cornell University, where I was a McMullen Fellow and won the H.D. Block teaching award. I received my Masters and Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2002.
