## Research


I love all things scientific/mathematical. My primary areas of interest are:

- Discrete optimization, graph theory and clustering algorithms
- Uncertainty quantification and rare events
- Quantum computation
- Nonlinear dynamics, bifurcation theory, numerical methods, and hybrid systems
- Distributed Computation
- Mechanics and Dynamics of Nano- and Micro-mechanical Systems
